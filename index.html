				<p>
					Our exhibit is focused on the idea that science and art are not opposites. Rather, they go hand in hand and are complements. The purpose of is to bring together all fields and to break that invisible wall that separates each one - in other words, we seek to open minds - and to show that every field is equal to another. Every person on this planet is human. Each one of us works to make the universe beautiful. They create all the same and they imagine all the same, yet they create differently and imagine differently. At the core, humans are all innovators and creators and strive to imagine in every shape and form, be it art, science, math, engineering, music, philosophy and many more. In the words of Carl Sagan, "It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works -- that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it."
