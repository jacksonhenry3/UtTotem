					Imagine RIT: Innovation and Creativity Festival is a campus-wide event that showcases the innovative and creative spirit of RIT students, faculty and staff. Visitors experience the breadth and depth of RIT through interactive presentations, hands-on demonstrations, exhibitions, and research projects set up throughout campus. Inflatables, games and multiple performance stages with live music and entertainment are also a hit with visitors of all ages. Held annually each spring, Imagine RIT is the kickoff to Rochesterâ€™s rich festival season.

				<h1><span style = 'font-weight:800;'>Our</span> Projects</h1>
					<h2>Music Theory</h2>
					<p>
						Display the beauty in music and the mathematics behind it. We might be making an interactive cymatics display
					</p>
					<h2>Origami</h2>
					<p>
					Origami involves significant geometric math to make really awesome paper art. 
					We will be making a paper sculpture and having people come up and make origami.
					</p>
					<h2>Recursion/Computer Science</h2>
					<p>Recursive drawings are based off of a mathematical set of patterns that extend to infinity.Using computer programming we will show how beautiful these patterns are
					</p>
					<h2>Light and Color</h2>
					<p>
					Lasers and black light art make some pretty cool art. 
					We will be making a luminescent floor piece of Milky Way that will light up when walked upon.

					Our project involves showing that The Sciences and The Arts are not as opposite as they are taught to be but rather they are fully integrated into one. "Ut totum" is latin for "as a whole." Here we will be posting our progress and showcasing the importance of combining science and arts as a full integration of reality.
