					 Each year at RIT, there is a huge event called ImagineRIT which is an innovative and creative festival throughout campus. Our project involves showing that The Sciences and The Arts are not as opposite as they are taught to be but rather they are fully integrated into one. "Ut totum" is latin for "as a whole." Here we will be posting our progress and showcasing the importance of combining science and arts as a full integration of reality.
