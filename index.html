				<p>
					Our project involves showing that The Sciences and The Arts are not as opposite as they are taught to be but rather they are fully integrated into one. "Ut totum" is latin for "as a whole." Here we will be posting our progress and showcasing the importance of combining science and arts as a full integration of reality.

					Imagine RIT: Innovation and Creativity Festival is a campus-wide event that showcases the innovative and creative spirit of RIT students, faculty and staff. Visitors experience the breadth and depth of RIT through interactive presentations, hands-on demonstrations, exhibitions, and research projects set up throughout campus. Inflatables, games and multiple performance stages with live music and entertainment are also a hit with visitors of all ages. Held annually each spring, Imagine RIT is the kickoff to Rochesterâ€™s rich festival season.
