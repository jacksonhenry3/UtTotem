					<p>
						Origami can take on intricate and complex patterns to become almost terrifyingly beautiful. We will delve into the fine line between the aesthetics of paper folding and its mathematics in this project. Historically, origami was created as gifts - for good luck, or for mourning, or as a peace offering. Together with the attendants of Imagine RIT, an elaborate sculpture of paper will be constructed as a gift to be donated to Imagine RIT.

					<h1><span style = 'font-weight:800;'>Computer</span> Science</h1>
					<p>
						 The beauty of mathematical concepts is often difficult to appreciate, let alone visualize. But through the use of technology and computer science, programming can be utilized to express the subtle artistry of math and bring its abstract concepts down to reality.

					<h1><span style = 'font-weight:800;'>Light </span>& Color</h1>
					<p>
					Light is the fastest thing in the universe, traveling at a speed greater than we can imagine. A vibrant, dynamic, and vital source of energy, it drew humanity out of the dark ages. In this project, we will illuminate the dazzling aspects of visible light and paint a literal picture in your mind and on the wall for all to see.
