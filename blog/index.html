					Whoa, look at all of these awesome submissions! There's so much talent in the students here at Rochester Institute of Technology. <a href = 'http://www.rit.edu/imagine/posters/2014/'>Link to Posters</a>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Some of these submissions we can see the art and science is very present, thriving in a lot of these creative minds. Here and now (well... in May) is the perfect place and time for a reformation-- a Renaissance if you will-- to combine these two awesome things.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Also, vote for your favorite poster! Maybe you'll see it around campus or the greater Rochester area one day!

				<h3>"Ut totum" is Latin for "as a whole!"</h3>
				<p>
					How does this tie in with our project?
					<br><br>
					Well, our goal is to integrate the world's preconception of The Sciences and The Arts and prove that they really are one and the same with respect to reality. 
					<br><br>
					I know in our group, some of us were confused about why this name was chosen (since Latin is a dead language). Hope this clears things up for everyone else!
